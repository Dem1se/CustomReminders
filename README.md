# CustomReminders
Stardew valley mod to set custom reminders in game

Have you ever wanted to do something after a few days or on a season start and later realized, that you completely forgot to do that thing?
This is mod is for you then!
SDV has a lot of things to do, and the hustle of tending to the crops and animals every morning may leave you forgetting what you wanted to do initially,
the things you promised yourself you'd do after the daily toil, but always forget to.

Using this mod you can set reminders in game, for example, A reminder to farm Melons for the Community center bundle the next summer,
or maybe to catch sturgeons during the next winter to start a caviar farm, or maybe even to buy seeds the next day (since you went to Pierre's on a Wednesday :D)... 
The potential is limitless. Download this mod to keep your progress on the fast lane, and to maximize the efficiency of your gameplay hours.
